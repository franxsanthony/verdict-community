## Roadmap

### Jan 18, 2026: Core Platform
**Instant Codeforces mirror**, VS Code + Whiteboard workflow, local judge, and analytics. We solved the 15s tab-switching headache.

### Coming Soon: Multiplayer Rooms
**Real-time collaborative coding rooms.** Send a link to a friend, recruiter, or professor and solve hard problems together on the cloud.

### Future: AI Tutor Agent
**Personalized AI Trainer** that generates multimodel (voice/video) and text explanations. It analyzes your code in real-time to help you solve, innovate new answers, and guide you without giving away the solution.

## Repository Structure
- `/app` - Next.js 16 frontend and API routes.
- `/extension` - Source code of the Verdict Browser Extension.
- `/mirror` - Puppeteer-based Codeforces scraping service.
- `/scripts` - Database and maintenance utilities.
