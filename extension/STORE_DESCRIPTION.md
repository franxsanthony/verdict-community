Experience Codeforces like never before. One-click submissions, instant test runners, built-in whiteboard, and a unified modern UI.

## Detailed Description

**Transform your competitive programming workflow with Verdict.**

Codeforces is the home of competitive programming, but navigating its many tabs—problems, submit pages, status lists—is slow and breaks your flow. Every tab switch costs you precious seconds (15s+!) that add up during a contest.

**Verdict Helper** connects the powerful **Verdict.run** platform directly to Codeforces, giving you a lightning-fast, all-in-one environment to solve problems efficiently.

**✨ Why You'll Love It:**

*   **⚡ Unified Workflow**: Read the problem, write code, and check results in a single, clean window. No more chaotic tab switching.
*   **💻 Embedded VS Code Editor**: Enjoy a full-featured coding experience with autocomplete and modern tooling without leaving the page.
*   **🧪 Instant Test Runner**: Don't wait for the slow Codeforces judge queue! Our built-in local judge runs sample cases **instantly** so you can debug fast before you commit.
*   **✏️ Built-in Whiteboard**: Sketch ideas, draw graphs, and visualize your algorithm right next to the problem statement.
*   **📤 Smart One-Click Submission**: Submit directly to Codeforces and get your verdict delivered safely and fast. The extension even handles Gym auto-joining and smart error reporting automatically.
*   **📊 Analytics & History**: Track your performance with detailed submission history and speed analytics.

**Stop waiting on loading screens. Start solving.**
Add Verdict Helper to your browser and experience the future of competitive programming.
